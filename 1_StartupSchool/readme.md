# How to talk to users

 *- by Eric Migicovsky Founder of Pepple*

### Notes

- Good founders maintain a direct connection with their users
  - It is your job as a CEO, CTO, COO to talk to customers
  - Develop and talk to users
  - Customers buy the why and not the what

- The mom test
  - Talk about their life, not your idea
  - Talk specifics, not hypotheticals (Erase the would you like feature-x questions)
  - Listen, don't talk

- Five great questions to ask in a user interview
  - What is the hardest part about [doing this thing]?
  - Tell me about the last time you encountered that problem...
  - Why was that hard? Tell me about the specific things...
  - What, if anything, have you done to try to solve the problem? 
    - if they are not trying to solve it, check your idea
  - What don't you love about the solutions you've tried?

- Talking to users is useful at all stages
  - Idea stage &rarr; find users with problem x
    - Friends, co-workers, intros, drop by in person, industry events
    - Good founders are users by themselves
    - Tips: take notes, keep it casual, careful with their time

  - Built prototype &rarr; best first customer
    - Identify the best first customer, do not artificially trap yourself
    - Find numerical answers to:
      - How much does this problem cost them? &rarr; Severity of Pain (ROI, Savings)
      - How frequent is the problem? &rarr; Frequency (Daily, Monthly)
      - How large is their budget? Ability to Fix? (Budget, Authority)

  - Launched &rarr; find product market fit
    - Iterate towards product-market fit
    - Ask your customers weekly: How would you feel if you could no longer use product x
      - Iterate towards high score of "very disappointed answers" (more than 40% is good)
    - Tips:
      - Ask your customers for their phone number during signup (direct channel to customer)
      - Don't design by committee (Don't ask users for better features)
      - Discard bad data (Compliments, Hypothetical assumptions)

# How to prioritize your time

*- by Adora Cheung Founder of Homejoy*

### Notes

- The opportunity costs are very high running a startup
  - Prioritize your time
  - Everyone has a different situation
  - Be honest with yourself

- Real vs. fake progress, delivering real value to user vs. delivering points to your ego

  - Real startup progress are things which really push your KPI growth
    - Revenue or active users
    - Set weekly goals for primary KPI
    - Tasks: talking to users or building / iterating product

  - Fake startup progress KPIs (Almost all the time wrong)
    - Winning awards, conferences, lots of advisors, pitch competitions
    - Press announcements, forbesEveryoneUnder30, networking events
    - Twitter activity, meeting famous people, optimizing bullshit metrics

 - Task prioritization
   - Try this: Write down every hour on what you were working on and if it drives your primary KPI for one week
   - Usually we are on autopilot and do things which we do not carfully think about (low value work)
   - Keep a spreadsheet of ideas that can move your primary KPIs --> talking to users / building product
   - Just write them down, don't execute them right away, otherwise your mind starts to jump around
   - Weekly weight them on your weekly goal impact: high, medium, low --> Did it move your primary goal
   - Weight them with the complexity of the task: easy, medium, hard
   - Focus on high/easy and high/medium
   - Avoid low/hard, low/medium
   - Don't do too many things at once, become a finisher

- How well am I prioritizing

  - Writing weekly updates and be very honest about it
    - How are the primary KPIs (actual vs goal)
    - What was the biggest obstacle to growth
    - Which tasks were accomplished + their impact
    - What were the big learnings

  - Review your weekly updates after time
    - Am I learning fast enough
    - Do I predict impact well
    - Did low value work creeped in
    - What are consistent blockers to growth
    - Did I complete tasks in a timely manner (Task is to complex or schedule needs to be updated)

- Key to success
  - Get your schedule together
  - The art of moving fast = decisiveness
  - The key is to make wrong choices and learning fast

### Addons

  - If your customers are churning what should you focus on?
    - Finding out what the problem is (ask customers)
    - Solve the problem
    - Find 10 users which really love your product

  - Tips
    - Get your schedule precicely correct if you are a single founder
    - Do not overhire people, use software as much as possible
    - Do not make paid advertising until you have product market fit
    - Weekly standups are great, daily is overkill

  - The makers schedule, managers schedule
    - Manager schedule is for bosses, traditional appointment book, 1 hour blocks
    - Maker schedule are free timeblocks, a free day to code is the best thing
    - They work fine until they interfere, be open from each side
    - Put meetings with other people at the end of the day, because they don't interrupt

# How to pitch your startup

*- by Kevin Hale Founder of Wufoo*

### Notes

 - A startup idea is a hypothesis which consist of three parts
   - a Problem, a Solution and an Insight
   - Problem characteristics: Popular, Growing, Urgent, Expensive, Mandatory, Frequent
   - Idea should be a solution in search of a problem (SISP)

 - How to communicate your idea
   - People don't understand the importance of expressing yourself
   - Don't sell your idea, tell them facts

   - For a really good investor these questions pop up, the founder just needs to be clear
     - Do I (as an investor) understand the idea?
     - Am I excited by idea?
     - Do I like the team?
   - Make things easy to understand
     - Make it legible (readable for everyone), make it simple, make it obvious

   - Do avoid
     - Ambiguity
     - Complexity
     - Mystery (Jargon, Fake, Suggest)
     - Ignorable (Marketing-speak, MBA-speak, Buzzwords)

   - Be Conversational (No Jargon, No prolog, Reproducible)
     - What are you making?
     - What is the problem?
     - Who is the customer?

     - Examples (should clearify the question: Should I use X for Y)
       - Airbnb is the first online marketplace that lets travelers book rooms with locals, instead of hotels
       - Dropbox synchronizes files across your/your team's computers
       - Lumineye is building x-ray vision for soldiers and first responders
       - Vahan is building LinkedIn for the next billion internet users
     - Lead with what, and not why and how

    - Be concise, use as few words as possible
    - Be aware of your noun you are using, they have the valuable information

  ### Addons

  - Killer tips on a demo day
    - Simple and fundamental for all visitors

  - An idea is a reflection of your mind

  - If I have a complex problem, what should I do then?
    - Do both? One for specific channels and one for general

  - The investor needs to feel energized and wants to leave Y-Combinator :rocket:

  - How and why is important but do not put them all in one place

  - How do you know if a found product market fit?
    - If you are not able to ask this question because your are so busy
  
  - What do you do if you have multiple stages?
    - Start with one business
    - Remove everything and be very efficent

# How to plan an MVP

 *- by Michael Seibel CEO of Y-Combinator*

 ### Notes

 - Launch quickly
 - Get initial customers
 - Talk to customers and get feedback
 - Iterate (improve the product)

 - Lean MVP (in most cases)
   - Very fast to build (weeks not months)
   - Very limited functionality
   - Appeal to small set of users and highest order of problems
   - Base to iterate from (just start)

 - Heavy MVP
   - Insurance or Banking Industry
   - Hardtech (Rockets)
   - Biotech
   - Moonshot (Hyperloop)

 - Launch is absolutelly not special
 - Get any customers is the main goal
 - Put the thing in front of the customer

 - Hacks for building an MVP quickly
   - Time box your spec
   - Write your spec
   - Cut your spec (It is okay)
   - Don't fall in love with your MVP

 - It might turn out that the full thing you want to build is not actually that awesome
 - Question yourself: does your product has direct users

 ### Addons

 - Never ask your customers for features
 - MVP should not be perfect, it just should work
 - Ask your users: does it solve your problem
 - Solve the problems right in front of you
 - If you don't know someone with the problem, leave it
 - How do I find product market fit --> If you're asking you don't have it
 - Ask your initial customer about other customers with the same problem
