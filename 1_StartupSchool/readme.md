## How to talk to users

 *- by Eric Migicovsky Founder of Pepple*

### Notes

- Good founders maintain a direct connection with their users
  - It is your job as a CEO, CTO, COO to talk to customers
  - Develop and talk to users
  - Customers buy the why and not the what

- The mom test
  - Talk about their life, not your idea
  - Talk specifics, not hypotheticals (Erase the would you like feature-x questions)
  - Listen, don't talk

- Five great questions to ask in a user interview
  - What is the hardest part about [doing this thing]?
  - Tell me about the last time you encountered that problem...
  - Why was that hard? Tell me about the specific things...
  - What, if anything, have you done to try to solve the problem? 
    - if they are not trying to solve it, check your idea
  - What don't you love about the solutions you've tried?

- Talking to users is useful at all stages
  - Idea stage &rarr; find users with problem x
    - Friends, co-workers, intros, drop by in person, industry events
    - Good founders are users by themselves
    - Tips: take notes, keep it casual, careful with their time

  - Built prototype &rarr; best first customer
    - Identify the best first customer, do not artificially trap yourself
    - Find numerical answers to:
      - How much does this problem cost them? &rarr; Severity of Pain (ROI, Savings)
      - How frequent is the problem? &rarr; Frequency (Daily, Monthly)
      - How large is their budget? Ability to Fix? (Budget, Authority)

  - Launched &rarr; find product market fit
    - Iterate towards product-market fit
    - Ask your customers weekly: How would you feel if you could no longer use product x
      - Iterate towards high score of "very disappointed answers" (more than 40% is good)
    - Tips:
      - Ask your customers for their phone number during signup (direct channel to customer)
      - Don't design by committee (Don't ask users for better features)
      - Discard bad data (Compliments, Hypothetical assumptions)
